 Coronary_Disease
CAD is a heart disease. ML is used to predict this disease
Introduction:
Overview:  Heart disease prediction using ML involves analyzing the patient data to identify people at risk and saving potential lives.
Importance:  Improving patient outcomes, reducing mortality, optimizing healthcare resources
Problem Statement: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, with heart disease being a significant contributor. Early detection and management are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. 
Objectives: improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection.
Data Collection:

Splitting features and target
Splitting data into training data and testing data
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Results and Analysis:
Evaluation Metrics:
    Accuracy on training data : 0.84
    Accuracy on testing data : 0.80
Key Findings: 
   Early Detection
   Better Health
   Challenges:
   Data quality
   Limited data
Data Bias
   Limitation of using the technique:
   Sensitive to outliers
   Limited to binary outcomes
Conclusion:
Summary: 
Data is collected and processed to check the missing values then data is separated into training and testing. Training data is used in feeding the model which is logistic regression and heart diseases are predicted based on binary outcome.
Future Work:
   Data enhancement and integration
    Advanced ML models
